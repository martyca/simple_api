#SIMPLE API

this is just a quick and dirty docker container for hosting an api.
The api returns json on the `/status` path which looks like this `{"status": "GREEN"}`
I use this for my esp projects that need a centralised place for fetching COLORS.
I keep this here so I can pilfer patterns from HTML and NODEJS.
